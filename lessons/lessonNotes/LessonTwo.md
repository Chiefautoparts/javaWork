# Lesson Two

## FizzBuzz

### Objective:

**Create a Java program that does the following tasks**

- [] Takes in an Integer as a parameter
- [] If the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz
- [] If the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz
- [] If the number is divisible by both print FizzBuzz
- [] If the number is NOT divisible by either print Number Not Divisible by 3 nor 5
- [] print the results for these test numbers
	1. 3
	2. 5
	3. 15
	4. 7

## You will need to create two java files. 
## Name one FizzBuzz.java and the other FizzBuzzTest.java


*Below is code to help you get started*


*FizzBuzz.java*
```
public class FizzBuzz {
	public String fizzBuzz(int number){
		// your code goes here
		// remeber this file is not printing anything only returning results
	}
}
```
*FizzBuzzTest.java*
```
public class FizzBuzzTest {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		// import your FizzBuzz Method
		// call the method attatched to your variable
		// print the results for your test numbers
	}
}
